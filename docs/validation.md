# Validation notes

This records the v0.1 validation performed on September 7, 2026. Native interaction was exercised on macOS. Linux is a portability target, not a validated release platform. These checks are local; no CI or notarized distribution is claimed.

## Automated and build checks

The completed workspace run passed **73 tests**, strict workspace Clippy, and a release build. Tests use disposable repositories for operations that create Git objects, refs, or worktrees.

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo test --locked --workspace
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --release --locked -p gitturtle
```

Coverage includes repository roots and merge parents, branches and linked worktrees, unusual path bytes, binary/text/mode/type changes, SHA-256 repositories, missing partial-clone objects, local LFS integrity and symlink rejection, Git process deadlines, and repository-file snapshots with hostile configured helpers. Preview tests cover decoding limits, alpha handling, SVG resource rejection, and LFS pointer recognition. App tests exercise queue replacement, stale-work cancellation, cache identity and accounting, BGRA conversion, local LFS arrival, refreshed branch/worktree tips, and graph budgets. New coverage includes branch folder expansion/filtering, retained repository sessions, and old/new line numbering for unified patches, including header-like source text, accumulated gutter-wheel movement, worker-prepared patch metadata, and its cache allocation budget.

A local macOS `.app` can be built with [the packaging script](../scripts/package-macos.sh). It is signed ad-hoc for local use, not notarized. The script's `--debug` option packages a debug build, while the default uses release; `--no-build` reuses the selected profile's existing executable.

## Column layout update

The updated release has a full-height history table and persistent right-hand commit/file inspector. Explicit file activation opens a full-height comparison; Back returns to retained history. Local and remote references are grouped into branch folders. Unified patches now have a separately painted old/new line-number gutter, preserving the literal editor text.

The final 73-test run (44 app, 17 core, 12 preview), strict workspace Clippy, and release packaging passed after these changes. Native checks resumed after the Mac was unlocked. On the demonstration repository, the full-height history/comparison layout, separately aligned old/new gutter, read-only typing, literal patch copying, keyboard activation, and Back navigation were exercised. The right inspector retained its dragged width across mode changes. Branch-folder expansion, temporary search expansion, branch scoping, merge-parent changes in both modes, added/modified/deleted images, and missing-LFS messages behaved as expected. Opening a non-repository folder cleared previous navigation and content and displayed the error.

The final scrolling pass verified linked drag-to-pan on both axes at 200%, reversal to the origin, and dragging across the preview toolbar. The CUA horizontal wheel gesture emitted a zero x/y delta during diagnostic tracing despite a positive horizontal scroll range, so horizontal trackpad behavior remains unverified by that tool. Vertical wheel panning was verified.

On `world-of-claudecraft`, both code-area and gutter wheel scrolling kept a 114-line patch aligned. Back restored the same history viewport (first visible `8b337c1`, selected `1e11554`), file selection, and inspector. Worktree filtering and opening the `feature/freeholds` worktree succeeded; the navigator showed 130 worktrees. An immediate image-open-and-Escape action remained in History after the preview completed. Earlier native checks below apply to the previous layout and are retained as historical evidence.

At `3053ac9`, patch gutter rows, width, and decoration ranges moved to the repository worker, with their retained allocations counted in the preview cache. The packaged release was checked again: gutter/code scrolling remained aligned, Before was empty for an added file, After displayed syntax-highlighted source, and Back retained the selected commit and file.

## Initial native macOS checks (before column layout)

The application was opened against the locally available `world-of-claudecraft` repository containing **5,577 branches and 130 worktrees**, and against a generated demonstration repository.

| Area | Exercised behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Repository navigation | Large branch/worktree lists, local/remote branches, native folder picker, invalid-repository errors, and draggable history/sidebar dividers |
| Commit inspection | Changed-file selection, explicit merge-parent comparisons, locked-worktree display, and selected-commit preservation while expanding history |
| Text | Unified patch and Before/After views; typing did not edit the preview; text selection and copying worked |
| Images | Modified, added, and deleted PNGs; transparent pixels; linked zoom and vertical panning |
| Unavailable content | Binary file information and missing local LFS image messages |

The earlier horizontal-wheel check was inconclusive. The column-layout update above adds and verifies two-axis mouse dragging; horizontal trackpad gestures remain unverified.

These are manual checks of the initial native build, not an exhaustive platform or accessibility certification. The [design document](design.md) includes intended behavior beyond the implemented surface.

To create a fresh disposable demonstration repository:

```sh
python3 scripts/create-demo-repo.py
cargo run --release --locked -p gitturtle -- .local/demo-repository
```

The generator also creates a linked worktree. It refuses nonempty destinations, including existing repositories. For another run, choose a fresh destination with `--output /path/to/empty-or-new-directory`; do not point it at a working repository.

## Timing methodology

Initial backend observations, hardware/toolchain details, and the reproducible inspection command are recorded in the [Git service benchmark notes](../crates/git-core/README.md#initial-measurement-september-7-2026). The backend harness measures Git service work. It excludes UI dispatch, queuing, image decode, editor preparation, rendering, and presentation. Filesystem caches were not flushed, so those observations are not cold-disk results.

The native app has a separate optional trace:

```sh
GITTURTLE_TRACE=1 target/release/gitturtle /path/to/repository
```

`gitturtle.commit_files_frame_ms` now measures a History selection through its changed-file list frame. `gitturtle.file_preview_frame_ms` measures an explicit file activation through its prepared comparison frame. History selection does not eagerly prepare a file preview. Returning to History uses retained state without a new Git request. Both metrics start in the application handler and use a generation- and mode-checked GPUI callback; they exclude input delivery before the handler, OS presentation, and completed GPU execution. Superseded interactions emit no sample.

The earlier `gitturtle.selection_frame_ms` trace, used for the historical measurements below, starts in the application selection handler. For a commit selection, it includes reading the changed-file list and preparing the chosen file preview; a direct file selection starts at that file's handler. The value is emitted at a GPUI frame-completion callback after the current preview is prepared, with a generation check to suppress superseded results. It does not measure input delivery before the handler, OS display presentation, or completed GPU execution. Interactions without a completed preview do not produce this sample.

The status bar's **content read** duration covers worker processing, including a content-cache lookup on a hit. It excludes time waiting for the worker and subsequent editor construction or frame work. Comparing this value directly with another client's click-to-visible delay would be misleading.

Native trace samples should be reported with the build profile, repository, selected content, sample count, system load, and cache conditions. No frame-latency or memory guarantee is established by the current checks.

## Column-layout native measurements

On Apple M4 Max / macOS 26.6.2, release `9b47e08` opened `world-of-claudecraft` with 500 commits loaded. Twenty Down actions followed by twenty Up actions produced 40 changed-file-list frames and **zero file-preview frames** during History navigation. A separate 40-selection text/code traversal inspected commit `1e11554`.

| Build and interaction | Samples | Median | 95th percentile | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `9b47e08`: commit to changed-file list | 40 | 29.913 ms | 46.964 ms | 64.041 ms |
| `9b47e08`: file to prepared text preview | 40 | 7.690 ms | 10.497 ms | 10.736 ms |
| `3053ac9`: file to prepared text preview | 40 | 5.523 ms | 7.517 ms | 7.722 ms |

The `3053ac9` confirmation used a fresh application process and the same immutable commit and file traversal after moving patch metadata preparation to the worker. Its initial file-open frame was excluded from traversal statistics. Both file runs started and ended on `headless/gathering_goal_protocol.ts`, traversing through `src/sim/professions/material_goal_projection.ts` before returning. Each action was followed by a native accessibility observation. Return selections can hit the 32-entry content cache; editors are constructed lazily.

Filesystem caches were not flushed, and other desktop applications and development activity remained running. These are small local measurements with different process/cache conditions, not a controlled comparison or proof of an improvement. The callbacks do not measure completed display presentation. Neither file run measures image decoding, and no latency or memory guarantee follows from these samples.

RSS after outbound/return traversal was approximately 129.9/130.0 MiB for History and 140.3/140.6 MiB for text comparisons at `9b47e08`; the final text run at `3053ac9` recorded 133.1/128.1 MiB. These are process snapshots, excluding separate GPU accounting. Raw samples, initial-frame exclusions, cache conditions, and boundaries are saved in [the column-layout record](benchmarks/2026-09-07-columns.json) and [the final prepared-diff record](benchmarks/2026-09-07-prepared-diffs.json).

## Initial optimized native measurements (before column layout)

On Apple M4 Max / macOS 26.6.2, the release build at `8b0799e` opened `world-of-claudecraft` with 500 loaded commits. We sent 25 Down actions and then 25 Up actions, observing the native accessibility state after each. The OS filesystem cache was not flushed; other desktop applications and development activity remained running. This is a small first measurement, not a comparative benchmark or latency guarantee.

| Completed preview samples | Count | Median | 95th percentile | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Navigation, excluding initial selection | 49 | 21.882 ms | 29.838 ms | 308.598 ms |
| Return traversal (subset above) | 25 | 21.910 ms | 27.176 ms | 27.216 ms |

The initial selection callback took 72.441 ms; that excludes repository discovery and history loading and is not application startup time. Fifty navigation actions emitted 49 completed-preview samples; absent samples are not counted as zero latency. The 308.598 ms outlier is retained, and this trace does not isolate its cause. The raw samples, method, and limits are in [the measurement record](benchmarks/2026-09-07-native.json).

Process RSS snapshots were about 142.3 MiB after the outbound traversal and 143.4 MiB after the return. These snapshots exclude GPU memory accounting and do not establish a memory-growth guarantee. The locally packaged app occupies about 30 MiB on disk.

## Known limits and follow-up

- The UI loads 500 commits initially and adds 500 per **Load more**, up to 10,000. It reloads the full prefix and restores the selected commit/preferred file when possible, centering the history selection. It does not retain an incremental history traversal cursor. Search covers loaded commits.
- Refresh is manual and resolves the selected scope's current tip. Another tool is responsible for fetches. Missing objects are reported without automatic downloads.
- Text uses a unified patch plus Before/After tabs. A separate old/new gutter accompanies unified patches; there is no aligned split view. Parent controls expose the first 128 parents of unusually large merge commits with an explicit count notice. The UI's initial file list omits rename detection, displaying additions and deletions instead.
- Images use a first-frame preview capped at a 1,600-pixel edge. Zoom percentages refer to that decoded preview; original dimensions and reduced preview dimensions are shown. SVG filters and embedded/external images are explicitly unsupported.
- Graph preparation allows at most 128 simultaneous lanes, 200,000 edges, and 200,000 parent entries. Above the budget, the UI explains why connections are hidden and shows isolated nodes instead of incomplete ancestry lines.
- The preview cache is limited to 32 entries and 128 MiB of retained CPU content allocations. UI-held references and GPU resources have separate lifetimes. Active decoder work stops at cooperative checkpoints; input and allocation limits are not a process sandbox or a hard end-to-end deadline.
- Native Linux builds and interactions, Linux packaging, automated CI, and notarized macOS distribution have not been validated or provided.
