# GitTurtle patch to gpui-component 0.6.0

This directory contains the exact crates.io `gpui-component` 0.6.0 source under Apache-2.0. `LICENSE-APACHE` is byte-for-byte preserved, and `.cargo_vcs_info.json` identifies published source revision `94a313a72a2513aee2780240cd322d552b2395f0` (`crates/component`). The registry archive checksum is `9bd7938c395be32cea6127b92f7206501ad1fe7e121a609de1aafdedcb4d98be`. Dependency versions are unchanged. The registry-only `.cargo-ok`, `.cargo-checksum.json`, and package lockfile are omitted; GitTurtle uses the workspace lockfile.

The input patch modifies `src/input/input.rs` and `src/input/state.rs`. The styled Input previously attached its role, name, author identifier, placeholder, value and SetValue action to the surrounding frame, while the shared text editing state owned the active keyboard FocusHandle on a different element without a role. GPUI 0.3.4 only records a focused accessibility node when that same element has a node; otherwise its tree falls back to the window root. This was a separate source defect from the macOS first-responder adapter attachment.

The component now projects its resolved metadata to `gpui-base::input::InputBaseState` through the matching local base patch. The existing editing element exposes the field semantics and SetValue action. The frame keeps its distinct focus handle for containment and focus-ring behavior and becomes presentational. Input, Textarea and Editor continue to use their existing shared editing engine, key bindings, selection and focus handle. No duplicate focus handle registration or native focus changes are introduced.

The projection contains no text copy. Values remain lazily materialized only while an accessibility client is active; masked inputs and Password/NewPassword content types never expose values, including when their visible mask is switched off. Disabled and read-only fields do not advertise SetValue; the existing editing engine still enforces its mutation rules. Existing component regression probes now inspect the editing-state node, with the original action helper retained only for tests.

`cargo test --locked -p gitturtle input_semantics_follow_the_editing_focus_owner` checks the actual component-to-state projection, editing focus, role, updated names, author identifier, placeholder, presentational frame, and editable/disabled/read-only/password/multiline action metadata in a synthetic GPUI window. The platform has no active assistive client, so this is rendered-node and keyboard-focus evidence, not native VoiceOver evidence. macOS AX focused-element and VoiceOver checks remain a separate package gate. Remove the component and base input patches together once a matching upstream version supplies equivalent semantics and those regressions pass.

The control-geometry patch modifies `src/button/button.rs` and `src/icon.rs`.
Button's inner content previously replaced an explicitly supplied text size and
icon/label gap with its size-category defaults; Icon similarly replaced explicit
pixel geometry when its containing Button supplied a default icon size. The
inner content now honors the caller's explicit font size and horizontal gap,
and styled icon dimensions take precedence over a component's default size.
Controls without explicit overrides retain their original size-category behavior.
No palette, focus, disabled, loading or action behavior changes.

`cargo test --locked -p gitturtle button_content_preserves_explicit_type_and_icon_geometry`
lays out real component Buttons and observes their inherited text size and
centered icon geometry in a synthetic GPUI window. It covers unchanged defaults
alongside distinct explicit font/icon sizes. Actual rendered controls across
themes, densities and enlarged interfaces still require native inspection.
